        <p>instructions for you, but
            also instructions for Word on how to format paragraphs as Heading 1, Heading 2, and such.</p>

        <p>Different versions of Word have different ways of saving these formatting styles on your computer. First,
            open this document on your computer.</p>
        <ul class="list-circle">
            <li class="list-text">If you are using Word 2010, select the Home tab, click on <i>Change Styles,</i>
                and then <i>Style Set</i>. Scroll to the bottom of the list of styles and select <i>Save as Quick Style
                    Set</i>. Save these styles as a Quick Style Set giving it a meaningful name.</li>
            <li class="list-text">If you are using Word 2016, select the Design tab and click on the pull-down
                arrow at the right of the display of designs. Select <i>Save as New Style Set</i>. Save this style set,
                giving it a meaningful name.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To attach the styles to a blank document or one that you have already created, do the following. Open the
            document.</p>
        <ul class="list-circle">
            <li class="list-text">If you are using Word 2010, select the Home tab, click on Change Styles, and then
                Style Set. The name you gave the style set should appear in the list. Click on it to attach it to your
                file.</li>
            <li class="list-text">If you are using Word 2016, select the Design tab and click on the pull-down
                arrow at the right of the display of designs. The Style Set you saved should appear under Custom. Click
                on the name to attach it to your document.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you don’t want to save the styles, save this document under a new name. Delete from the top of page 2 to
            the end. You will have the correct formatting for the first page and the paragraphs, as well as the
            paragraph styles and can copy and paste your paper into it.</p>
        <h1>General Information</h1>
        <p>Prepare your manuscript in Microsoft Word or export it from a different word processor into RTF format,
            following the specifications that we show here.</p>
        <p>For papers that deal with data analysis, make the data available to readers via a link you place in your
            paper to a website where you store your data, if at all possible. We can help.</p>
        <p>When you submit your paper for review, make sure that you have anonymized your paper by removing all
            references to yourself or your institution. Make sure these are removed from the document properties as
            well. To have your paper reviewed, you need first to submit a “blinded” version (without author or
            affiliation information) that can be blind reviewed. After your paper is accepted, add the author
            information.</p>
        <h2>Language and Grammar Consistency</h2>
        <p>We publish papers written in English. If you have questions on English grammar or punctuation, search the web
            for guidance. You can find excellent guides at <a href="http://www.grammarbook.com"
                class="hyperlink-text">http://www.grammarbook.com</a> and <a
                href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar"
                class="hyperlink-text">http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar</a></p>
        <p>While we prefer the use of U.S. spelling, we accept other versions of English as long as they are used
            consistently throughout the paper.</p>
        <h3>Use of the singular “they”</h3>

        <p>
            <span class="content-text">When the gender of a person is unknown, the use of the singular “they” is
                accepted. Do
                not use expressions such as “s/he” or “his or her.” </span>
            <a id="_Hlk37057714"><span class="example-text">For example, “Each student submitted their art portfolio to
                    the
                    committee” is correct. If using the singular “they” as a generic third-person pronoun seems awkward,
                    try rewording the sentence or using the plural, such as “All students submitted their art portfolios
                    to the committee” </span></a>
            <span class="content-text">or “The art portfolio of each student was submitted to the committee.” More
                information
                about this is at </span>

        </p>

        <h1>Content</h1>
        <h2>First Page Layout</h2>
        <p>To put the first page of your document in the proper format, copy the content of the first page from this
            file into your document and fill in the abstract information.</p>
        <h3>Author information (<span class="highlighted-underline">added after paper has been accepted</span>)</h3>
        <p>Once the Editor has accepted your paper, insert the full name, the affiliation (University or Company), City,
            Country, and email address for each author into the table on the first page. Insert additional rows if there
            are more than two authors. If there is more than one author, place an asterisk after the corresponding
            author’s name.</p>
        <p>In the Author section at the end of the paper, add a short biography and a head-and-shoulders photo (if
            available) for each author.<span class="spacing-space">&#xa0;&#xa0;</span></p>
        <h3>What to put in the abstract</h3>
        <p><span class="highlighted-underline">The abstract is a brief summary of the contents of the article; it should
                give enough
                information to make the reader want to learn more about your research,</span> but it needs to be
            concise. In each of the boxes on the first page, enter one or two brief sentences appropriate for your
            paper. Omit citations from the abstract; citations for the paper’s sources do appear in the body of the
            paper.</p>
        <p>If any of the abstract subtopics do not apply to your paper, put “NA” in that box.</p>
        <h2>Body of Paper</h2>
        <h3>Introduction or background</h3>
        <p>All papers should begin with an introduction that sets the stage for the discussion. For some disciplines, it
            is more appropriate to use Background as an alternative first section.</p>
        <h3>Body</h3>
        <p>The body is a collection of multiple sections describing the main content of the paper. You should use up to
            three levels of headings to categorize content as deemed necessary: Heading 1, Heading 2, and Heading 3.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This section summarizes the paper, presents challenges, suggests future study, and so on to create a lasting
            impression of the paper.</p>
        <h3>Appendix</h3>
        <p>If there is an appendix, place it after the References and before the Biography. If there is more than one
            appendix, add a letter after “Appendix.” Appendices must be mentioned at the appropriate places within the
            body of the document.</p>
        <p>If you have used a questionnaire in a study, include a copy of it as an appendix.</p>
        <h3>References</h3>
        <p>Following the conclusion is a list of all references used in the body of the paper. The current APA
            formatting guidelines are used to make internal citations within the body as well as provide the complete
            alphabetic list of reference citations at the end of the paper. (See the Entering References section for
            more details. We have placed a summary of these guidelines at <a
                href="https://www.informingscience.org/Uploads/APA_7ed.pdf"
                class="hyperlink-text">https://www.informingscience.org/Uploads/APA_7ed.pdf</a> ) The References list
            contains <span class="emphasized-bold">only</span> works cited in the paper and <span
                class="emphasized-bold">all</span> works
            cited in the paper must be listed in the References section.</p>
        <h2>Author Information with Picture</h2>

        <p><span class="content-text">After the paper is accepted, at the end of the paper, for each author please
                provide a one
                or two paragraph biography that describes the author’s background relevant to this article. If you have
                one, insert a head-and-shoulder photo to the left of the biography of each author or send it separately
                and we will insert it.</span></p>
        <h1>Page Formatting</h1>
        <p><span class="content-text">To make it easier to read the paper online, use single-column formatting for the
                paper.</span></p>
        <h2>Page Size</h2>
        <p><span class="content-text">Set the paper size to Letter, which is 8 1/2 by 11 inches.</span></p>
